Sat-Solver

# This program takes as input a CNF boolean Formula in DIMAC'S format, and determines if the formula is satisfiable. 
# If the boolean formula is satisfiable, the program returns "SAT", followed by the assignments of the variables
# in increasing order (i.e. variables 1,2,3,...) that make the formula true. If the program prints "-1" for 
# any of the variables, it implies that any assignment of such variable, will satisfy the formula.
# If the formula is unsatisfiable, then the program returns "UNSAT."
