#Sat-Solver
### This program takes as input a CNF boolean Formula in DIMAC'S format, and determines if the formula is satisfiable.  If the boolean formula is satisfiable, the program returns "SAT", followed by the assignments of the variables in increasing order (i.e. variables 1,2,3,...) that make the formula true. If the program prints "-1" for any of the variables, it implies that any assignment of such variable, will satisfy the formula. If the formula is unsatisfiable, then the program returns "UNSAT."
### In the future I would like to optimize the program, by implementing a faster SAT solving algorithm such as the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, or  the conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) algorithm.
